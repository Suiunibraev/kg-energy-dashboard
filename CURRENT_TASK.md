# Current Task Handoff

## What Was Being Worked On

The latest work completed a Version 1 credibility-language pass without changing forecast values, scenarios, Security Index weights, or regional source values.

- Added an auditable Security Index breakdown matching the existing calculation.
- Added dashboard cards showing each component's weight, contribution, current indicator, and explanation.
- Replaced the demonstration regional CSV with the Settlement Center's official
  2024 useful-supply values and row-level provenance.
- Disabled regional production, losses, balance, status, risk ranking, and the
  related recommendation because compatible official inputs are unavailable.
- Removed the accounting reconciliation residual from Executive Overview KPIs.
- Renamed synthetic monthly history as estimated history and confidence language as illustrative model ranges.
- Added exact forecast-period labels and elapsed-period warnings.
- Reclassified regional population as Official source / mapped.
- Disclosed that related energy-coverage components account for 60 of 100 Index points.
- Resolved the reported `security_index_breakdown` import issue and confirmed that `app.py` imports successfully.

## Files Modified

The relevant current files are:

- `energy_dashboard/policy.py`
  - Defines `security_index_breakdown(national, forecast)`.
  - Mirrors the existing Balance, Hydropower Risk, Demand Growth, and Reserve Margin calculations.
  - Returns both display-oriented columns used by `app.py` and lowercase contract columns: `component`, `weight`, `score`, and `explanation`.
- `app.py`
  - Imports and calls `security_index_breakdown`.
  - Displays four component cards and the summed final score.
  - Presents the regional rows as ПЭС service territories rather than strict oblasts.
  - Shows official useful supply and derived per-capita/share indicators.
  - Removes the regional risk chart and production-versus-consumption comparison.
- `energy_dashboard/data_sources.py`
  - Loads `data/regional_useful_supply_2024.csv`.
  - Preserves source year, source document, source URL, and row-level provenance.
  - Exposes production, losses, and balance as unavailable rather than estimating them.
- `data/regional_useful_supply_2024.csv`
  - Contains the eight official 2024 ПЭС useful-supply rows and source provenance.

## Outstanding Bugs

- No active ImportError remains; `security_index_breakdown` is defined and importable.
- The methodology remains a prototype requiring expert calibration.
- The full pytest suite is installed and passes.

## Next Steps

1. Validate Security Index weights and component overlap with sector experts.
2. Replace synthetic monthly history with observed monthly data when available.
3. Extend the official ПЭС series when additional annual Settlement Center publications are validated.
4. Obtain compatible official production and distribution-loss data before considering regional balance or risk calculations.

## Current Branch Status

- Branch: `main`
- Tracking: `origin/main`
- Current working tree contains the Version 1 credibility and regional-map updates described above.

## Incomplete Changes

- Official ПЭС production and distribution-loss fields remain unavailable.
- Regional balance, producer/consumer status, and risk ranking remain disabled.
- The Security Index transparency work is implemented and visually verified; dedicated breakdown test coverage remains optional follow-up work.

## Verification Already Completed

- The full pytest suite passes.
- Python compile checks passed.
- Streamlit visual verification confirmed the Regional Planning page renders the
  official ПЭС source notes, territorial caveat, useful-supply total, and no
  unsupported regional risk calculation.
